# Web 3 Projects

The idea of this repository is to create a collection of projects focused on Web 3 development, with an emphasis on decentralized technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Each project has its own folder with detailed instructions in the `README.md` file inside the folder.

## Technologies

- **Solidity**: For smart contract development.
- **Ethereum**: Main blockchain used for testing and implementation.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Libraries for blockchain and front-end integration.
- **React.js**: For creating user interfaces.
